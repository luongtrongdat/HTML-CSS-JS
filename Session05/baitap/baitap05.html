    <h1 class="h1">5. Groups of selectors</h1>
    <p>A comma-separated list of selectors represents the union of all elements selected by each of the individual selectors in the list. (A comma is U+002C.) For example, in CSS when several selectors share the same declarations, they may be grouped into a comma-separated list. White space may appear before and/or after the comma.</p>
    <div class="block">
      <p>CSS example:</p>
      <br>
      <p>In this example, we condense three rules with identical declarations into one. Thus,</p>
      <br>
      <p>h1 { font-family: sans-serif }</p>
      <p>h2 { font-family: sans-serif }</p>
      <p>h3 { font-family: sans-serif }</p>
      <br>
      <p>is equivalent to:</p>
      <br>
      <p>h1 { font-family: sans-serif }</p>
